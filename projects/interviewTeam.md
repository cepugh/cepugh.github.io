summary: Built, organized, and co-lead an interview team for a Hawaii-based contract for Booz Allen Hamilton
---
When I first got to Hawaii, the contract I was working on for Booz Allen Hamilton was based out of Maryland, but had a small amount of people in Hawaii. The team was in the process of increasing personelllll. There were no set defined hiring processes in place due to the small numbers. Since the team was in search of new talent, I decided to jump in and help establish some processes! 

Along with some fellow collegeus, we built an interview team. We established concrete processes to include scheduling, resume reviews, and collaborating with our counterparts in the Maryland/DC area. 

Being apart of this process really helped me understand the dynamics of working with multiple people across geological obstacles. The contract I was employed under was one of the larger contracts, with hundreds of employees. The intricacies of hiring out here in Hawaii and coordinating back to Maryland took a lot of communication and organization. In addition, I learned about how to interview and scope out technical talent. Some of the positions we were trying to fill weren't within my area of expertise, so I collaborated with other Booz Allen employees and brought in experts during those interviews.
