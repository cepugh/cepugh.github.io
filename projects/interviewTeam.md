summary: Built, organized, and co-lead an interview team for a Hawaii-based contract for Booz Allen Hamilton
---
While working for Booz Allen Hamilton, in Hawaii, I built an interview team to find new potential and fill slots within the the contract I was working under. I organized the team and set up processes to review resumes and effectively work with our counterparts in the Maryland/DC area.

Being apart of this process really helped me understand the dynamics of working with multiple people across geological obstacles. The contract I was employed under was one of the larger contracts, with hundreds of employees. The intricacies of hiring out here in Hawaii and coordinating back to Maryland took a lot of communication and organization. In addition, I learned about how to interview and scope out technical talent. Some of the positions we were trying to fill weren't within my area of expertise, so I collaborated with other Booz Allen employees and brought in experts during those interviews.
