summary: "Assisted in teaching Python to beginners at Booz Allen Hamilton sponsored PyNight events"
---

Booz Allen Hamilton sponsors events called PyNights that are set up in a sort of capture the flag style setting. A series of puzzles are presented to each person and as they solve them they get points. These puzzles progressivley get more difficult, and the winner at the end of the night is awared some sort of prize. There is also a "Noob Nook" set up for absolute beginners where they are walked through how to get everything set up and taught the basics and fundamentals. At multiple events, I helped run the noob nook and taught beginners the basics of programming. During this time I was in charge of teaching basic lessons and helping students solve basic problems. I did this in the Maryland/DC area, but Hawaii also has similar events. A group called PyHawaii exists where they hold meet ups and similar events! I really encourage any level programmer to give these events a try! They are great for networking and the chance to learn something new!
