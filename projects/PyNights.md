summary: "Assisted in teaching Python to beginners at Booz Allen Hamilton sponsored PyNight events"
---

Booz Allen Hamilton sponsors events called PyNights that are set up in a sort of capture the flag style setting. A series of puzzles are presented to each person and as they solve them they get points. These puzzles progressively get more difficult, and the winner at the end of the night is awarded some sort of prize. There is also a "Noob Nook" set up for absolute beginners where they are walked through how to get everything set up and taught the basics and fundamentals. At multiple events, I helped run the noob nook and taught beginners the basics of programming. During this time I was in charge of teaching basic lessons and helping students solve basic problems. I did this in the Maryland/DC area, but Hawaii also has similar events. A group called PyHawaii exists where they hold meet ups and similar events! I really encourage any level programmer to give it a try! They are great for networking and the chance to learn something new!

The things I've learned about data throughout my experiences and career thus far is that almost every job and field work with a lot of data! Basic programming skills and scripting can dramatically help any organization! Events like PyNight and groups like PyHawaii draw people in from all kinds of backgrounds to help them get started with basic coding skills. I foresee having these types of skills as a great benefit in the future of all fields, and I hope to continue to be apart of groups and organizations that enable a community of learning and innovation!
