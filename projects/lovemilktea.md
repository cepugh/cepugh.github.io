## About LoveMilkTea
<p> LoveMilkTea is an application created to help students, faculty, or visitors to the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus, navigate their way around. The application combines crowdsourcing and collaboration to help the user's find all the tricky and hidden places of interest, that Google Maps misses, such as bathrooms and vending machines. By providing directions, exploring options and user submitted places of interest, the application makes navigation at the University much easier!</p>

## HACC 2017
<p> In the fall of 2017, I took a ICS491 Special projects course that consisted of creating an app and entering the [<i class="github icon"></i>Hawaii Annual Code Challenge](http://hacc.hawaii.gov/). I joined a team of 7 other UH ICS students and we took up the challenge, submitted by """ of creating an application that would make navigating a complicated campus, such as the UH campus, a bit easier. Our team set out to quickly put together a creative and effective solution to the problem in the short three weeks deadline. We pulled together a pretty decent working prototype and managed to win 1st place!
