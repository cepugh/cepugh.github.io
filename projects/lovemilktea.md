## About LoveMilkTea
<p> LoveMilkTea is an application created to help students, faculty, or visitors to the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus, navigate their way around. The application combines crowdsourcing and collaboration to help the user's find all the tricky and hidden places of interest, that Google Maps misses, such as bathrooms and vending machines. By providing directions, exploring options and user submitted places of interest, the application makes navigation at the University much easier!</p>

## HACC 2017
<p> In the fall of 2017, I took a ICS491 Special projects course that consisted of creating an app and entering the Hawaii Annual Code Challenge. I joined a team of 7 other UH ICS students and we took up the challenge, submitted by """ of creating an application that would make navigating a complicated campus, such as the UH campus, a bit easier. Our team set out to quickly put together a creative and effective solution to the problem in the short three weeks deadline. We pulled together a pretty decent working prototype and managed to win 1st place!

## Development of LoveMilkTea
<p> LoveMilkTea was built using Ionic, which is an open-source SDK for hybrid mobile app development built on Angular. This means our team was able to easily create a web and mobile app from one code base, written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We used the Google Maps API for our map and decided to stick with Google Firebase for authentication and databasing.</p>
<p> The first three weeks of the application development were a part of the HACC contest, so the intent was to get a basic working application ready for the judges. Our team split up the application into major focus areas and each tackled our parts. We used issue driven development and met twice a week. After the HACC, our team continued to refine the app as a part of the ICS491 course. We worked on cleaning up the code and adding functionality. </p>

## My Contributions and Lessons learned
<p> My main focus areas were the administrator page and functions, and user accounts and authentication. I created the user accounts and the abiity for user's to submit points, along with the administrators portal to approve, edit or deny submissions </p>
<p> Altogether, the HACC and the course in general were great experiences for me. The HACC was the first hackathon I had ever participated in, and learning how to put together a functioning product with new technology in a short period of time was a very valuable experience. We also had a large team, and I learned a lot about coding on a large team. The team had a lot of momentum and made great progress during the HACC, however after the HACC, a lot of the motivation seemed to dwindle. Other priorites for team mates took precedence, and the team couldn't meet as often. I think this was a huge factor in the fading motivation. I learned that meeting face to face with team members is key to keeping momentum on a project going. Even though much of the work can be done virtually, nothing can replace the value of face to face meetings. </p>
