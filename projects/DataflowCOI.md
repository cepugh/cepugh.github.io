summary: Enabled greater learning amongst a large enterprise by creating a community of interest (COI)
---

Before taking some time of to finish my Computer Science degree at UH Manoa, I worked for Booz Allen Hamilton as a cyber analyst for a Department of Defense client. During my time with this client, myself and a few fellow analysts recognized some serious problems with how information was spread throughout the enterprise. I encountered a problem that I couldn't solve or find the information to solve it. After searching around and asking all the right people, I learned this information was just not easily available. I knew a few analysts who felt the same way, so created we community of interest to tackle a specific gap in the understanding of how certain systems worked and how analysts could benefit from understanding them. Our team congregated knowledge from multiple sources and experts on specific systems and made it digestible to the common analyst. We created an in-depth presentation that was presented multiple times to large groups. Then using new technologies to enhance learning, it was recorded and archived on a community webpage for future analysts to view. 

I learned many things from this experience! First of all, in technical work environments, documentation of knowledge is crucial! In a lot cases, the knowledge we found was from an expert on the topic or someone who had encountered similar problems. We never would have known about their insight on the topic had we not asked them individually. If they had an easy way to share their knowledge, they probably would have. I think it is crucial for an enterprise or group of people working on similar things to set up easy, effective, and standardize ways of documenting knowledge. Also, multiple people working on technical problems almost always yields better results. More brains equal more power!
