Coding standards do not seem like the most exciting aspect of programming, but they are definitely one of the more important concepts to ensure quality software. I think a lot of people see it as one of the lesser exciting aspects and a necessary evil. However, just as grammar and composition are important to any written language, coding standards set out important guidelines and rules for programs.

As projects grow in size, coding standards become more and more imperative. Coding standards ensure that software written by dozens or even hundreds of people are consistent and efficient. I can only imagine how frustrating it would be to read multiple other people's code, all with their own style or nuisances. Even more, fixing bugs with dozen's of different "coding flavors" implemented in the SAME piece of software. It would be a mess and not to mention unprofessional.

With all this being said, I understand the initial frustration with it! For example, I have grown really fond of using (i++) to increment the value of i up one. Turns out it is frowned upon by the coding standard we are using for our coding projects in my software engineering course. We are using the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide with Eslint. Take a look...

  I guess they have a pretty good reason. Im sure I'll adjust for the greater good of coding.
