 *"It’s OK to be ignorant; it’s not OK to play stupid" - Eric Raymond*
  
  I think we can all say we’ve had conversations with well intentioned people asking a seemingly simple question, while in your head you are screaming “I am not Google!”.  This is the world that the more advanced software engineers and developers live in, especially since most basic questions have been asked before and documented in a forum that is easily Google-able.  The technical world can also be very challenging for beginners, so of course a lot of questions need to be asked! But a lot of beginngers aren’t sure which questions are considered “dumb” questions or good questions.  Bombarding experts with simple, Google-able questions wastes everybody’s time. To address this, Eric Raymond provided a really great <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html" style="color: rgb(0,128,255)">article</a> on how to ask smart questions!  This light humored article really helps lay out the types of questions that are likely to gain attention or be thrown to the wayside.  It definitely gave me a better insight into how I can improve my questions and thoughts! As Eric Raymond said ““It's OK to be ignorant; it's not OK to play stupid.“
  
  
Here are some examples of real questions asked by people on Stack Exchange.

GOOD:


- Very clear subject line that was specific to the problem
- The body of the question is very precise and has the posted code for others to inspect 
- The problem appears to be something they have already atttempted and failed at finding a solution
- It seems to be a good question since it has been viewed many times and has complete and helpful awnsers

BAD:

This question would fall into the "dumb" category. 

- This person pasted a bunch of code without much context or what errors they were getting
- It was voted down 14 times and the comments are mostly "Ask better questions!" 
- One person even linked to a specific stack overflow post on how to ask questions! <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask" style="color: rgb(0,128,255)">http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask</a>




  I have been told many times, from both bosses and professors, that communication, even in the technical world, is vitally important! With this in mind, Eric Raymond’s article addresses a particular aspect of the hacker culture that I think is important for people to understand. Eric Raymond quoted “What we are, unapologetically, is hostile to people who seem to be unwilling to think or to do their own homework before asking questions.” His point is, value in time, conciseness, productivity, and thirst for challenging problems that advance everybody is often mistaken for cruelty or insensitivity. I ran into this problem a few times working with developers before I entered the computer science field. I was convinced these people hated me! Once I started to understand the culture, I realized it wasn’t personal. I also find myself much more understanding of people with those attitudes. There is a deep value and passion for learning and sharing knowledge. It’s a quick moving field and those that care enough will put the time to self educate themselves and bring forward thought provoking, challenging ideas.
