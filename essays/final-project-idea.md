### Overview
The problem: Many adventures are interested in finding new hikes, beaches, or activites on the island, however finding quality activites can be a challenge. Often times when searching for an activity you find yourself lost in a large amount of blog-like data with no way to vet whether the activity is quality. 

The solution: A crowd sourced application that allows users to add activities to the site that can then be liked or rated by other users. This would allow for the top rated activites to easily found. The application could also link of people with similar interests or help users find local secrets

### Mock up page ideas
Some mock up pages include:
Public Landing page
Login page
User home page (items the user has personally added)
Admin home page
User profile page
Main adventure page (lists the items which can be sorted by tags)
Add item page (where users can add their own item)

### Use Cases
New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile.
Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site.
User goes to landing page, logs in, gets Main adventure page, browses items, rates items
User goes to landing page, logs in, goes to add item page, adds new adventure item
User goes to landing page, logs in, goes to friends profile page to check what they've added
