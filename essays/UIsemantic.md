I have zero experience in web development of any kind.  To be honest, I’ve never had any real interest in it. However, I do have an appreciation for a clean, well-formatted site. I have visited a poorly done website and immediately thought less of the entire organization too many times. It is clear that a user interface into an application is critical for the success of the application.

On that note, my software engineering class had an entire week of building websites using HTML and CSS. This new experience was a bit cumbersome, but not too bad. However, the sites were very basic and clearly fell into the “crappy website” realm. Then the next week our professor introduced UI Semantic, and my whole idea about creating websites changed. I feel like UI Semantic made it possible for me to make decent looking sites without the requirement for me to be a full-fledged graphic designer, or spend large amounts of time mastering HTML/CSS. This was a liberating idea to know that I can create a semi decent web page if I am in the position of needing to in my future. 

For the most part, the UI Semantic framework was just as easy as directly using HTML and CSS. Because I wasn’t proficient in any of this before, it was no different to me whether I was looking up how to create something in HTML/CSS or looking for a class that did the same thing in UI Semantic. The UI framework is also much more powerful, so I feel like UI Semantic has my vote.
